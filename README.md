# 2d-tennis-game
This project demonstrates how to create a simple 2D tennis game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a browser-based game where you control a paddle to compete against a computer-controlled opponent. The game is built within a single HTML file, combining all required functionalities for easy deployment and testing.
